def twoSum(array, target):
    """ Initial attempt at solving two sum problem.

    Iterating through the array twice yields a O(n^2) solution. We can do
    better.

    Args:
        array (list): List of ints to search for sum.
        target (int): Int value we are searching for.

    Examples:
        >>> array = [0, 6, 2, 7, 12]
        >>> target = 13
        >>> twoSum(array, target)
        [1, 3]

    Returns:
        list of indexes containing the two numbers that sum to our target.
